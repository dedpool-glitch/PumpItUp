# PumpItUp
PumpItUp is the name of the competition that was hosted by DrivenData on their website. In this we were given over 60000 instances of water pumps that were set up in Tanzania at some point of time. The dataset had variables such as village name, population in proximity of the water pump, total amount of water available to the water pump and much more. 
We had to predict the operationality of the water pump, which had 3 nominal levels, "operational","operational but needs repair" and "non-functional".
Classification algorithms had to be used.
I achieved a final accuracy of 78.4% on the leaderboard. I was in the top 20 percentile of the competition.
